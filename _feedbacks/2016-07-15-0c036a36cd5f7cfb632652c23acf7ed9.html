    <b>Comment:</b> Hi Jose<br />
    <br />
    I've seen some good videos you have posted on youtube and would like to learn more about ACI.<br />
    <br />
    I wanted to ask besides the free resources from Cisco in the operations guide and the tshoot guide, are there any other material you can suggest or share to get more in depth in ACI.<br />
    <br />
    The only experience I can have is using Cisco's dcloud simulator but I can only make tenant level changes however I would like to have more freedom to check out more information on the fabric and access policies. If you can share some documentation on ACI that would be very helpful<br />
    <br />
    Your blog is awesome and very informative hence why I was reaching out to you.<br />
    <br />
    Thanks again.<br />
    <br />
    Regards<br />
    <br />
    Dave<br /><br />
