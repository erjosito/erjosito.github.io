<p>Admittedly, I am sick. That is at least what most people would say, if I told them that last night I was having fun programming in Python in order to automate a VXLAN environment using an EVPN control plane. Whaaaat???</p>
<p>In my opinion, VXLAN fabrics with EVPN are really cool. Lots of benefits over traditional designs: scalable, IP-only backbone, standards-based, with optimal forwarding (routing in the ToR switch), and I am probably forgetting some.</p>
<p>One issue though is that the configuration gets more complex. Creating tenants and networks gets more complex as your grandpa’s VLANs and SVIs with Spanning Tree.</p>
<p>A colleague of mine asked me this week whether I had any Python script to help alleviate this configuration complexity, and so I started with it. The first Python script became pretty fast a Python module, and in order to test all that I did a quick shell based on the cmd2 module. Which is quite cool by the way.</p>
<p>The secret sauce here is the API of Cisco Nexus switches (aka NXAPI), and how to leverage it with Python. For this last point I used the Python library here: <a href="https://github.com/datacenter/nexus9000/tree/master/nx-os/python/remote_client">https://github.com/datacenter/nexus9000/tree/master/nx-os/python/remote_client</a>, or from here, with a .tgz file you just need to unpack: <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/fileMedia/download/0eb10f7e-b1ee-432a-9bef-680cb3ced417">https://developer.cisco.com/fileMedia/download/0eb10f7e-b1ee-432a-9bef-680cb3ced417</a>. In my test I have Nexus 9000, I understand the Python functions would work slightly differently with other Nexus, testing N7Ks or N5Ks would be a logical next step here.</p>
<p>So at the end a shell with commands to create networks and tenants across multiple switches emerged. And equally important, to remove the config when it is not required any more. I recorded a demo in this video, so that you can see the shell in action without having to install it:</p>

<p>Another Cisco colleague told me once that he doesn’t read any blog that doesn’t include code, so here you are: I have uploaded all functions in a single module in Github: <a href="https://github.com/erjosito/evpn_shell">https://github.com/erjosito/evpn_shell</a>.</p>
<p>WARNING: I wouldn’t recommend anybody to use this thing in a production network, this is more of a concept validation. A lot of stuff should be improved before calling this shell “production-ready” (for example, encrypting the passwords). But this gives you an idea of what is possible with scripting and Cisco Nexus REST APIs.</p>
