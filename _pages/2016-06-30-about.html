<p>My name is Jose Moreno, I am a Microsoft engineer passionate about increasing efficiencies in the DC. Today I focus in public cloud and Azure in particular, which I find fascinating, and frankly, I believe to be the future of IT.<br />
In my private time I can't help being a Star Wars fanboy... You can follow me in Twitter under @erjosito</p>
